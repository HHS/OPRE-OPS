## PS-04 - Personnel Termination

Upon termination of individual employment:
a. Disable system access within [as soon as possible but no longer than seven (7) calendar days following termination or, if necessary, prior to the formal termination action];

b. Terminate or revoke any authenticators and credentials associated with the individual;

c. Conduct exit interviews that include a discussion of [the terminated individual's continued obligations under information system non-disclosure, confidentiality, or user access agreements];

d. Retrieve all security-related organizational system-related property; and

e. Retain access to organizational information and systems formerly controlled by terminated individual.

## OPS Implementation

Parts (a and b): An OPS User Admin will revoke user authorization within OPS within the required timeframe after receiving a qualified authorized notification.

Notes:
-For systems that rely on identity and access management systems for access, termination or revocation of credentials effectively prevents system access.
-The organization must retain for a reasonable time period, not less than the period available for the employee to appeal the termination, all electronic documentation in an OpDiv-defined location, which can readily be retrieved in the event of litigation at a later date after a terminated employee has departed an Agency organization.
