TODO: Seek inherited text

OPS utilizes a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) process which includes end-to-end and unit testing of OPS functionality that must satisfy all test conditions successfully before allowing a deployment or promotion to any environment. The deployment and promotion process includes changes to documentation persisted in the OPS GitHub repository.

OPS utilizes a Continuous Deployment (CD) process using GitHub  and its version control such that duly-authorized and approved changes, via the mechanism of a GitHub Pull Request, are automatically deployed at the time the requested code branch (changes) are merged to the destiantion branch (environment). GitHub maintains full revision and release history for OPS.
