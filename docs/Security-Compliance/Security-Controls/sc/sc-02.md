# Separation of System and User Functionality
## SC-02 - Separation of System and User Functionality

Separate user functionality, including user interface services, from system management functionality.

## OPS Implementation

At an application level, OPS implements role and group-based access and privilege separation for users such that only users that need and have been authorized for administrative and system management functions within OPS will see and have access to those features.

The management aspects related to user authentication is entirely delegated out to and through AMS.
