# Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity
## SC-08 (1) - Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity | Cryptographic Protection

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information and detect changes to information] during transmission.

## OPS Implementation

OPS utilizes TLS connections for traffic passing between components and end user traffic and any interconnecting systems. For the Azure Database component, FIPS 140-2 is in use as the cryptographic module. The service uses Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) with AES 256-bit cipher included, and the keys are Azure-managed. For the Azure Application Gateway, Azure recommended and managed cipher suites are in use.
