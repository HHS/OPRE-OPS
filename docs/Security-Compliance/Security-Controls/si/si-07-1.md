# System and Information Integrity
## SI-07 (1) - Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity | Integrity Checks

Perform an integrity check of [system software, firmware, and applications deemed to be critical to the integrity or functionality of the system] [at system startup and restart]; [alert from a security related event/tool]; [or at least quarterly].

## OPS Implementation

OPS only utilizes and works only with HHS/ACF whitelisted and approved Azure products and services to address this control's requirement.

Integrity checks as per ACF's requirement are performed on a monthly basis as part of ACF Tech security's vulnerability scan. Utilization of new software and IaaS components is logged in GitHub and Azure (respectively). Software dependency verifications are performed at build-time as part of the CI/CD process.

TODO: container signing verbiage from si-7 and si-3.

### Control Origination

Inherited from ACF Tech and Azure.
