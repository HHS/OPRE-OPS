# System and Information Integrity
## SI-07 - Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity

a. Employ integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized changes to the following software, firmware, and information: [ACF-defined software, firmware, and information]; and

b. Take the following actions when unauthorized changes to the software, firmware, and information are detected: [system software, firmware, and information deemed to be critical to the integrity or functionality of the system].

## OPS Implementation

The firmware aspects of this control are all implemented by Azure.

With regards to software (code, builds, images):

OPS employs cryptographic provenance and signing for builds and container images. GitHub Actions generates artifact attestations (SLSA v1 Build L2 by default) and signed SBOM attestations for each build; attestations are published alongside images in GHCR. CI/CD gates verify these attestations before deploying to Azure Container Apps (ACA). 

Deployments pin images in scripts to ensure the exact verified artifact is deployed and executed. CI checks that the digest matches the scanned/provenanced image. 

The OPS GitHub repository also enforces integrity: required signed commits, PR review, and required status checks on protected branches/tags. GitHub environments gate pull request merging with required reviewers. 

See the OPS Configuration Management Plan for more details on the implementation of this control. 

### Control Origination

Hybrid with Azure, ACF Tech (AMS and Splunk), and OPS.

Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to errors or malicious activity. Software includes operating systems (with key internal components, such as kernels or drivers), middleware, and applications. Firmware interfaces include Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). Information includes personally identifiable information and metadata that contains security and privacy attributes associated with information. Integrity-checking mechanisms—including parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes, and associated tools—can automatically monitor the integrity of systems and hosted applications.
