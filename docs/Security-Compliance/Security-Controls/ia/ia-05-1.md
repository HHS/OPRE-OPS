# Identification and Authentication
## IA-05-01 - Authenticator Management | Password-based Authentication

For password-based authentication:<br />
(a) Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and update the list [ACF-defined frequency] and when organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised directly or indirectly;<br />
(b) Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords in IA-5(1)(a);<br />
(c) Transmit passwords only over cryptographically-protected channels;<br />
(d) Store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function, preferably using a keyed hash;<br />
(e) Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery;<br />
(f) Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces and all printable characters;<br />
(g) Employ automated tools to assist the user in selecting strong password authenticators; and<br />
(h) Enforce the following composition and complexity rules: [at least one (1) character from each of the four (4) character categories (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, special characters), minimum length of eight (8) characters for regular user passwords, and minimum length of fifteen (15) characters for administrators or privileged user].

* Note: This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner, when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., PIV cards). Also, administrator/privileged users are defined as those authorized for limited administrative purposes only based on business or technical need. Cryptographically-protected passwords include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against passwords, organizations may also consider salting passwords.
