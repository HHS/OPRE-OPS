# Identification and Authentication
## IA-05 - Authenticator Management

Manage system authenticators by:
a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator;<br />
b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization;<br />
c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;<br />
d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;<br />
e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;<br />
f. Changing or refreshing authenticators at least every 60 days; PIV (smart card) certificates must be renewed every five (5) years or when organization-defined events occur;<br />
g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;<br />
h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific controls to protect authenticators; and<br />
i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.

## OPS Implementation

OPS uses a common standard known as Open Authorization (OAuth) to communicate with HHS/ACF's AMS for authentication. All system authenticators are managed by AMS.
