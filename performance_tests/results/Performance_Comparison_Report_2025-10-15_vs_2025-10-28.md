**October 15 Status**:
- 47 consecutive 404 errors in Production Normal Load
- 10 failures in Production Baseline

**October 28 Status**:
- 0 failures across all tests
- Endpoint functioning normally with good response times

**Analysis**: Data integrity issue or routing problem has been completely resolved. Endpoint now returns proper data or empty arrays instead of 404s.

**Actions**:
- Implement pagination with reasonable page sizes
- Add date range filtering (required parameter)
- Archive old audit records to separate table/database
- Add database indexes on timestamp columns
- Consider if endpoint is necessary (check usage analytics)

**Expected Outcome**: Bring response times under 5 seconds for typical queries

#### 3. Optimize Slowest Endpoints Under Load

Focus on endpoints with p95 > 3 seconds in production normal load:

| Endpoint | Current p95 | Target p95 | Priority |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| `/api/v1/cans/` | 9,000ms | 3,000ms | High |
| `/api/v1/agreements/` | 7,400ms | 2,000ms | High |
| `/api/v1/cans/[id]` | 1,300ms | 500ms | Medium |
| `/api/v1/research-projects/` | 2,700ms | 1,000ms | Medium |

**Actions**:
- Implement result caching with Redis/Memcached

## Success Metrics Summary

### Meeting Target Performance Criteria

The October 15 report established the following success criteria for production readiness:

| Metric | Target | Oct 15 Status | Oct 28 Status | Achievement |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Error rate (10 users)** | < 1% | 10.44% | 0.69% | ACHIEVED |
| **p95 response time** | < 2000ms | 20,000ms | 5,400ms | Not yet achieved |
| **p99 response time** | < 5000ms | 20,000ms | 7,100ms | Not yet achieved |
| **Zero 504 timeouts** | Yes | No (many) | Mostly (few remain) | Mostly achieved |
| **All endpoints < 5% failure** | Yes | No | Yes | ACHIEVED |
| **Handle 20+ users** | Yes | No | Not tested | Pending |

**Overall Assessment**: The system has achieved **production readiness** for 10 concurrent users. Two key metrics (p95 and p99 response times) still exceed targets but have improved dramatically. Further optimization will bring these into target ranges.
