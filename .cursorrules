# Cursor AI Rules

## Commit Messages

When generating commit messages:
- Keep entire commit message to a maximum of 100 characters
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be concise and descriptive
- Follow conventional commits format when appropriate (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)

Example:
```
feat: add user authentication to API
```
