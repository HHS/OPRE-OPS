**What is OPS?**

OPS is the acronym for **O**PRE’s **P**ortfolio **M**anagement **S**ystem. It is a centralized place to plan and track OPRE’s budget and projects across Divisions and Portfolios.

OPS is a custom software application replacing OPRE’s legacy system known as the Management and Accounting of Projects System (MAPS). OPS has been designed using a human-centered design approach where everyday users are active participants in the design and direction of the system. OPS is currently in an early release and will continue to be expanded upon and improved as OPRE is using it. Your feedback is essential in making OPS a successful tool for all, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts and ideas!

**What benefits does OPS provide?**

**Transparency**

You can view high-level budget, spending and research data for each Portfolio and funding details for every CAN. Changes are tracked via history so you can easily understand who changed what and when.

**Data Visualization**

Budget and spending data can be viewed in diverse and customized ways like across a portfolio, project or CAN, in addition to the individual agreement level.

**Autonomy**

Team Leaders, CORs and other team members have the ability to create and edit their agreements directly eliminating the need to email the budget team for updates.

**Built-in Approvals**

Division Directors will formally approve budget and status changes in the system rather than through email.

**Real-time Planning**

Plans can be entered into the system as Drafts instead of having to wait until plans are more formalized. This will provide a more holistic view of the data across all stages of planning.

**The portfolio, project and agreement relationship**

Each OPRE division has one or more portfolios. Within each portfolio, projects can be created to assist in grouping different agreements together. There are different types of agreements which are contracts, grants, inter-agency agreements (IAAs), assisted acquisitions (AAs) and direct obligations.

**Definitions for portfolios, projects and agreements**

- Portfolio - a portfolio is a research entity or funding entity within OPRE
- Project - a project is a body of work composed of agreements that share a common topic or theme (often a research-related agenda or goal)
- Agreement - an agreement is a defined piece of work (possible subset of a broader project), often between OPRE and other contractors

**The agreement lifecycle and budget line statuses**

Budget line statues are used to track the current state of an agreement. There are 5 budget line statuses. All new budget lines start in Draft Status.

| Budget line (BL) Status | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Draft              | BL is in pre-planning, placeholders and what-ifs, not yet solidified |
| Planned            | BL is intended to happen and money can be set aside as planned (even though there might be changes). The dollar amount associated to the budget line will be subtracted from the available FY budget |
| Executing          | BL is in the procurement process, in progress to be formally committed |
| Obligated          | BL is committed in the signed award and can be invoiced against so the work can begin |
| In Review          | BL has pending edits or a pending status change request that needs to be approved or declined |

    - See How to create a project
1. Complete step 2 by filling out the agreement details and click the Continue button
    - Not all information is required at this stage, and can be completed later if necessary. However, all fields must be filled out before a budget line can be changed from Draft to Planned Status.
    - You can click the Save Draft button to save your data entry, exit the agreement creation process and return to it later, if needed
    - Anyone you add as a Team Member will be able to edit the agreement
        - Make sure you add yourself as a Team Member if you need to edit this agreement in the future [in the future, creators of an agreement will be automatically associated to the agreements they create]
        - Division Directors will be automatically added as Team Members for any agreement using CANs within their Division
        - Team Leaders will be automatically added as Team Members for any agreement using CANs within their Portfolio
1. Complete step 3 by adding service components (SCs) and budget lines (BLs)

    - Edit or delete the services component by hovering over the services component card and clicking the edit or delete icon on the right hand side
    - For Budget Lines: choose the services component the budget line belongs to, add an obligate by date, CAN and amount and then click Add budget Line
        - A BL ID# will be automatically assigned to each budget line after you create the agreement. This # is just a system reference number.
        - The fiscal year (FY) will be auto-populated based on the FY of the obligate by date you enter
        - The Fees will be auto-calculated based on the procurement shop you selected in Step 1
        - The total will be auto-calculated based on the amount + fees
        - All budget lines start in a Draft Status
    - Edit, delete or duplicate the budget line by hovering over the row and clicking on the edit, delete or duplicate icon on the right hand side
