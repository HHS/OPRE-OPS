**What is OPS?**

OPS stands for OPRE’s Portfolio Management System (OPS). It is a centralized place for OPRE to plan and track their budget and projects across Divisions and Portfolios.

**What benefits does OPS provide?**

**Transparency**

You can view high-level budget, spending and research data for each Portfolio and funding details for every CAN. Changes are tracked via history so you can easily understand who changed what and when.

**Data Visualization**

Budget and spending data can be viewed in more diverse and customized ways like across a portfolio, project, or CAN, in addition to the individual agreement level.

**Autonomy**

Team Leaders, CORs and other team members can create and edit agreements directly instead of having to email the budget team to make updates.

**Built-in Approvals**

Division Directors will formally approve budget and status changes in the system rather than through email.

**Real-time Planning**

Plans can be entered into the system as Drafts instead of having to wait until plans are more formalized. This will provide a more holistic view of the data across all stages of planning.

        heading: "How to understand OPS organization",
        content: `
**The portfolio, project, and agreement relationship**

Each OPRE division has one or more portfolios. This is the first level of organization.  Within each portfolio, projects can be created to assist in grouping different agreements together. There are different types of agreements which are contracts, grants, inter-agency agreements (IAAs), assisted acquisitions (AAs) and direct obligations.

**The agreement lifecycle and budget line statuses**

Budget line statues are used to track the current state of an agreement. There are 5 budget line statuses. All new budget lines start in Draft Status.

| BL Status | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Draft              | BL is in pre-planning, placeholders and what-ifs, not yet solidified |
| Planned            | BL is intended to happen and money can be set aside as planned (even though there might be changes). The dollar amount associated to the budget line will be subtracted from the available FY budget |
| Executing          | BL is in the procurement process, in progress to be formally committed |
| Obligated          | BL is committed in the signed award and can be invoiced against so the work can begin |
| In Review          | BL has pending edits or a pending status change request that needs to be approved or declined |
