# Mock Service Worker (MSW) Setup

This directory contains the setup for Mock Service Worker (MSW), which is used to mock API requests during development and testing.

## Overview

MSW intercepts network requests at the network level, allowing you to mock API responses without modifying your application code. This is particularly useful for:

- Testing components that depend on API responses
- Developing UI components without a backend
- Simulating error scenarios

## Files

- `handlers.js`: Contains the request handlers that define how MSW should respond to specific API requests
- `browser.js`: Setup for MSW in the browser environment (used during development)
- `server.js`: Setup for MSW in Node.js environment (used during testing with Vitest)

## Usage in Tests

To use MSW in your Vitest tests:

1. Import the server from `src/mocks/server.js` in your test file
2. Use the server to override handlers for specific tests if needed

Example:

```javascript
import { server } from "../../mocks/server";
import { rest } from "msw";
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from "vitest";

describe("MyComponent", () => {
    it("handles API error", async () => {
        // Override the default handler for a specific test
        server.use(
            rest.get("/api/data", (req, res, ctx) => {
                return res(ctx.status(500), ctx.json({ error: "Server error" }));
            })
        );

        // Your test code here
    });
});
```

## Usage in Development

To use MSW during development, you need to initialize the service worker in your application's entry point:

```javascript
// In your main.jsx or similar entry file
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
    const { worker } = await import("./mocks/browser");
    worker.start();
}
```

## Adding New Mock Handlers

To add a new mock handler:

1. Add your handler to the `authHandlers` array in `handlers.js`
2. Follow the pattern of existing handlers, using the appropriate HTTP method and endpoint

Example:

```javascript
rest.get(`${BACKEND_DOMAIN}/api/new-endpoint`, (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.status(200), ctx.json({ data: "Your mock data here" }));
});
```

## Benefits

- **Isolation**: Test components in isolation without depending on actual API endpoints
- **Reliability**: Tests don't fail due to backend issues
- **Speed**: Tests run faster without actual network requests
- **Flexibility**: Easily simulate different API responses, including error scenarios
