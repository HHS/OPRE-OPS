             The promotion of children’s safety, permanence, and well-being are the principles that guide child\
             welfare practice and policy. ACF seeks to improve the safety, permanency, and well-being of children through\
             leadership, support for necessary services, and productive partnerships with states, tribes, and \
             communities. ACF’s Children’s Bureau has the primary responsibility for administering federal programs\
             that support state child welfare services. ACF provides matching federal funds to states, tribes, and\
             communities to help them operate every aspect of their child welfare systems. This includes the\
             prevention of child abuse and neglect, the support of permanent placements through adoption and\
             subsidized guardianship, and the creation and maintenance of information systems necessary to support\
             these programs. ACF supports a number of research and evaluation activities as well as learning from a\
             broad array of other activities relevant to child welfare such as performance management, technical\
             assistance, stakeholder engagement, site monitoring, developing systems to oversee and use data, and\
             continuous quality improvement. ACF also analyzes and reports information on administrative data\
             such as the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), Adoption and Foster Care\
             Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), and National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD)\
             \n\nOver the past several decades, research and evaluation activities in child welfare have increased\
             significantly. This body of knowledge has shown that child maltreatment is a complex problem associated\
             with multiple, interrelated risk and protective factors at individual, family, community, and contextual\
             levels.  This research has demonstrated that child abuse and neglect may have long-lasting and cumulative\
             effects on the well-being of children into adulthood. There is burgeoning research examining the\
             potential effectiveness of preventative and intervention treatments to improve the safety, stability,\
             and well-being of children and their families.\
             \n\nOPRE’s child welfare research portfolio includes research on children who are maltreated or who are at\
             risk for child maltreatment; children and families who come to the attention of child protective services;\
             and children and families who are receiving child welfare services either in their families of origin or\
             in substitute care settings. OPRE also partners with the Children’s Bureau to conduct research covering a\
             broad array of topics, including identification of antecedents and consequences of child maltreatment,\
             strategies for prevention of maltreatment, and service needs and service outcomes for children who come\
             to the attention of child welfare.\

            Established in 1965, Head Start was designed to promote the school readiness of children, ages three to\
            five, from families with low income, by supporting the development of the whole child through high-quality,\
            comprehensive services. In 1994, the Early Head Start program was established to provide the same\
            comprehensive services to families with low income who have infants and toddlers, as well as pregnant\
            women. Today, ACF’s Office of Head Start oversees approximately 1,600 Head Start and Early Head Start\
            grant recipients that serve nearly one million children, birth to age five, and their families.\
            \n\nFor over 50 years, Head Start research has examined the impact of its programs as a whole, how those\
            impacts vary for different populations, communities, or program characteristics, how programs deliver\
            services, the quality of services, the qualifications of staff, and the characteristics and needs of\
            children and families. In doing so, Head Start research targets strategies for improving program quality\
            and child and family outcomes. Through partnerships between researchers and local programs, Head Start\
            develops and evaluates innovations in Head Start practice related to infant mental health, parenting,\
            dual language learning, curricular enhancements, caregiver-child interactions, dual-generation approaches,\
            and other topics. This growing research base provides valuable information not only for guiding program\
            improvements in Head Start itself, but also for the larger field of early care and education.\

            which is a block grant authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). In 2021,\
            CCDF made $9.5 billion available to state, territory, and tribal governments to support children and\
            their families by paying for child care that meets families’ needs and supports children’s development\
            and well-being. CCDF also provides funding to improve the quality of care by supporting efforts such as\
            child care licensing, quality improvement systems, and training and education for child care workers.\

        The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 established the\
        Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to help children and families with low incomes\
        achieve economic security and stability. Under TANF, states, eligible territories, and tribes receive block\
        grant funds to provide cash assistance to eligible families and a range of other services to accomplish\
        one of the program’s four broad purposes. While TANF jurisdictions must meet certain work\
        participation and cost sharing requirements, they have considerable flexibility to design and implement\
        programs that best serve their distinct communities.\
        \n\nPRWORA also authorized funding for welfare research, evaluation, and technical assistance activities.\
        The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 significantly increased the amount of this funding by\
        establishing a set-aside of 0.33% of the TANF block grant to support these activities. The legislation\
        directs ACF to use these funds for TANF-related research and evaluation; the development of a “what\
        works clearinghouse” of effective approaches for moving welfare recipients into work; technical\
        assistance to support TANF programs and services; and federal administration of these activities. The\
        set-aside and the research, evaluation, and technical assistance it funds is referred to as the ‘Welfare\
        Research’ portfolio.\
        \n\nOPRE’s Division of Economic Independence partners with the Office of Family Assistance (OFA) to carry\
        out the Welfare Research portfolio. OFA administers the TANF program; collects and analyzes program\
        data on caseloads, expenditures, and work participation; and provides programmatic technical\
        assistance to TANF jurisdictions. OPRE conducts rigorous research and evaluation to better understand\
        how TANF and other human services programs can best support the self-sufficiency and economic well-\
        being of children and families with low incomes. These studies address a range of topics including TANF\
        program administration; employment, training, and occupational skill-building programs; coordination\
        across social services delivery systems; and the role of broader social context and environmental factors.\
        Within these and related topics, OPRE funds experimental impact evaluations, implementation\
        evaluations, and descriptive research projects aimed at informing the design and implementation of\
        TANF programs and services. OPRE also supports activities to build the research and evaluation capacity\
        of TANF and other human services programs, and to communicate findings from the Welfare Research\
        portfolio to the broader field.\

            visitors and families: assessing family needs, educating and supporting parents, and referring families to\
            needed services in the community. Early childhood home visiting programs aim to improve a wide range of\
