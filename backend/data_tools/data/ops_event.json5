The contract will focus on developing content that facilitates streamlined, interoperable reporting to ACF. The contract will also conduct research and evaluation activities with states and tribal organizations to assess the effectiveness of providing these interoperability artifacts for these organizations to use. The ability to share data and develop interoperable data systems is important for effective operation and oversight of these programs.
