            "description": "        The National African American Child and Family Research Center, supported by a five-year OPRE        grant (2021 — 2026), will provide national leadership and excellence by investigating the assets, needs,        and experiences of the diverse population of African American families and children served (or potentially        served) by ACF programs, as well as promising approaches to address economic and social inequities and,        ultimately, promote social and economic well-being.  The primary focus of this Center will be on childcare        assistance, TANF, and Head Start and Early Head Start programs and the populations they serve. The work of        the Center will draw on interdisciplinary approaches to accomplish the three goals listed below.        \n\n1. Advance Research        The Center will plan, initiate, and maintain a community-engaged, focused, and high-caliber research program.        The Center’s program of research will build on the existing literature related to African American children        and families and should be directly relevant to the needs and interests of ACF areas of programmatic concern.        \n\n2. Build Research Capacity        The Center will build research capacity and infrastructure to conduct research relevant to ACF program and        policy goals that is culturally rigorous and informed by an understanding of current and historical        circumstances that shape the experiences of African Americans. In addition, the Center will contribute to the        development and expansion of the pool of researchers reflective of the communities being studied by the Center.        \n\n3. Communicate Research        The Center will develop and implement a dissemination strategy that broadly and efficiently communicates        findings from research conducted within and outside of the Center and increases the use of research, data, and        relevant resources for a wide audience including researchers, federal and state policymakers, ACF grantees,        program administrators, and communities participating in the research.        \n\nThe Center is led by the Morehouse School of Medicine.        \n\nThe OPRE point of contact is Megan Reid.
